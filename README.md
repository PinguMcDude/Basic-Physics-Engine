# Basic Physics Engine

Nothing serious, just a physics engine that I made to be able to visualize what I was being taught in physics. This is nothing advanced or optimized, it just covers basic high schools physics concepts so far, like acceleration and jerk, I do plan on adding more inputs as I go on.

## Getting Started

Run the installer and when you run the .exe it will prompt you to input the drop height, the vertical acceleration and jerk, then the horizontal acceleration and jerk, all in that order. When the simulation ends, just press space to close it, may take a second or two.

## Built With

* [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) - Simple and Fast Multimedia Library
